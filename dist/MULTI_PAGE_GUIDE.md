# Sweet Moment - Multi-Page Static Site Guide

This static site includes multiple pages (Home, Products, Categories, About, Contact) that work just like the original site.

## How to Navigate
- Use the main menu at the top of the page
- URLs use the hash symbol: /#/products, /#/about, etc.
- A navigation bar at the bottom of the screen provides quick access to all pages

## How It Works
The site uses hash-based routing to enable a multi-page experience without requiring server configuration.
All pages are available directly through URLs like https://username.github.io/repository-name/#/page-name.

## Disabled Features
Features requiring a backend (admin panel, checkout, user accounts) are disabled in this static export.
