# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for Sweet Moment

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the Sweet Moment static site to GitHub Pages, with special attention to the router configuration that prevents URL corruption issues.

## Preparing for Deployment

1. Extract all files from the ZIP archive to a local directory
2. Verify that the following files are present in the root directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `enhanced-router-fix.js` (v4.0 - with severe URL corruption protection)
   - `404.html` (improved version that prevents redirect loops)
   - `.nojekyll` (this file prevents GitHub Pages from using Jekyll processing)

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. Log into your GitHub account
2. Create a new repository (e.g., "SweetMoment")
3. Make the repository public
4. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license file

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Using Git

1. Initialize a Git repository in your local directory:
   ```
   git init
   ```

2. Add all files to the repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit the files:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SweetMoment.git
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

6. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Click "Save"

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Add the local folder as a repository
3. Publish the repository to GitHub
4. Enable GitHub Pages as described in Option 1, step 6

## Enhanced URL Protection for GitHub Pages

This package includes a comprehensive set of fixes for the common GitHub Pages SPA routing issues:

1. **Enhanced Router Fix (v4.0)**: A JavaScript solution that actively prevents URL corruption
2. **Improved 404.html Handler**: A better implementation that avoids the problematic `?/&/~and~` pattern
3. **Hash-Based Routing**: Uses `/#/` routes which are more compatible with GitHub Pages

### What URL Issues Are Fixed:

- **Infinite Redirect Loops**: Prevents the URL from continuously adding `/~and~/` segments
- **Malformed URL Parameters**: Detects and fixes URLs like `?/&/~and~/~and~/`
- **Repository Path Duplication**: Cleans up repeated repository names in the URL path
- **404 Redirect Corruption**: Improved 404 page that uses a safer redirect approach
- **Encoding Problems**: Fixes URL encoding issues that can break navigation

## If You Still Experience URL Corruption:

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies completely
2. Try accessing the site in an incognito/private browsing window
3. Make sure both `enhanced-router-fix.js` and the improved `404.html` are correctly deployed
4. Enable browser developer tools and check the console for any warnings from the router fix
5. Try manually triggering the fix by running `window.fixGitHubPagesUrl()` in the browser console
6. If the issue persists, try using the URL pattern `/#/your-page` instead of `/your-page`

## Testing Your Deployment

1. Your site should be available at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/SweetMoment/`
2. Try navigating to different pages using the menu
3. Refresh the page on different routes to ensure the routing works correctly
4. Check the browser console for any errors

## Important Note About Router Configuration

The enhanced router fix is specifically designed to work with wouter and similar client-side routers on GitHub Pages. The key improvements in this version:

1. **Early Intervention**: Detects and fixes URL corruption before it causes page refreshes
2. **Critical Pattern Detection**: Specifically targets the problematic `?/&/~and~/` pattern
3. **Force Reload Protection**: Will force a clean reload in extreme corruption cases
4. **Regular Expression Based Cleanup**: More sophisticated pattern matching for various URL corruption types
