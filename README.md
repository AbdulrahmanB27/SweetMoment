# Sweet Moment Chocolates - Complete Static Site

This is a comprehensive static version of the Sweet Moment Chocolates website, optimized for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repository (recommended name: `SweetMoment`)
2. Upload all these files to that repository
   - You can use GitHub Desktop or git commands to push the files
   - Alternatively, you can use the GitHub web interface to upload the files
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" → "Pages"
   - Under "Source", select the branch where you uploaded these files (typically `main` or `master`)
   - Click "Save"
4. Your site will be available at: `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/SweetMoment/`
   - If you've set up a custom domain, it will be available there instead

## URL Structure Notes

This build uses hash-based routing to ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages. 
URLs will have the format: `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/SweetMoment/#/page-name`

### Features & Capabilities

This static export includes:

- ✓ Complete product catalog with images and details
- ✓ All categories and site customizations
- ✓ Advanced URL routing that works properly on GitHub Pages
- ✓ Product review data
- ✓ Special 404.html to handle deep linking properly
- ✓ Automatic fix for duplicate repository segments in URLs
- ✓ Full site styling and UI components

### Troubleshooting URL Issues

If you encounter 404 errors or URL routing problems:

1. Ensure your repository name exactly matches `SweetMoment`. If you used a different name, you'll need to modify the base paths in index.html and 404.html.
2. Verify GitHub Pages is properly enabled in your repository settings.
3. The 404.html file contains special code to handle direct navigation to deep links - don't delete it.
4. This export includes automatic fixes for duplicate repository segments in URLs.
5. If you're using a custom domain, make sure it's properly configured in your repository settings.

### URL Fix Technical Details

This build includes an enhanced router fix that handles three common GitHub Pages issues:
1. Prevents duplicate repository segments like `/SweetMoment/#/SweetMoment/`
2. Properly redirects direct page loads to the equivalent hash route
3. Eliminates infinite redirect loops that can occur with certain URL patterns

## Features

- All product data is embedded within the static site
- Single Page Application (SPA) routing with hash-based navigation
- Dedicated 404.html page to handle direct navigation to any URL
- No backend required - the site is completely static

## Technical Details

- Uses hash-based routing (`/#/page` instead of `/page`)
- Enhanced router with duplicate repository segment detection
- 404.html redirector for handling direct deep links
